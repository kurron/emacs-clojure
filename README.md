emacs-clojure
=============

Configuration files and other goodies for a Clojure development environment based on Emacs.

* For Ubuntu 12.04, I had to [use a PPA to get emacs 24](https://launchpad.net/~cassou/+archive/emacs)
* Followed directions [clojure-doc.org](http://clojure-doc.org/articles/tutorials/emacs.html) to get everything loaded
* Rememember to soft-link the *.emacs.d* directory from your home directory.
